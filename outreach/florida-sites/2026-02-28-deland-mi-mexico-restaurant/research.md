# Research Notes — Mi Mexico Restaurant (DeLand, FL)

## Business Snapshot
- **Business name:** Mi Mexico Restaurant (also appears as “MI Mexico Deland” in some directories)
- **Category:** Mexican restaurant
- **City:** DeLand, Florida
- **Likely address (from public directory snippets):** 1570 S Woodland Blvd, DeLand, FL 32720

## Evidence for “No Website” (Reasonable Confidence)
### 1) Listing/Profile field appears to have no website
- Source used: OpenStreetMap Overpass query for DeLand amenities with `name` and missing `website` tag.
- Query logic intentionally filtered businesses where `website` is absent (`[!"website"]`).
- Mi Mexico Restaurant appears in the result set under this filter.

### 2) Web search for official domain
- Search URL:
  - https://duckduckgo.com/html/?q=Mi+Mexico+Restaurant+DeLand+FL+official+website
- Observed first-page style results (at capture time): Yelp, Facebook, menu aggregators, directory pages.
- **No clear official standalone business domain** appeared in the top extracted results.

## Public Listing Links (for follow-up verification)
- Yelp listing shown in search output:
  - https://www.yelp.com/biz/mi-mexico-deland-4
- Facebook listing shown in search output:
  - https://www.facebook.com/mimexicomexicanrestaurant/

## Confidence & Assumptions
- **Confidence level:** Medium
- Why medium (not high):
  - Overpass “no website tag” means no website is recorded in that profile data source, but does not guarantee no website exists anywhere.
  - Search extraction did not show an obvious official domain, but search results can vary over time/location.
- Before real outreach/publication, do a manual map/profile check in browser and confirm phone/address/hours directly with the business.
