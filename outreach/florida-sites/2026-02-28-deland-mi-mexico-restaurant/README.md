## Factual vs drafted/assumed content
### Intended factual (must still be verified before publishing)
- Business name and city
- Likely address from public listings
- Category/type of business

### Drafted/assumed content
- Some contact details and hours are placeholders/draft values
- Review quote text is sample marketing copy
- Ratings block is a summarized display, not a guaranteed live count
- Gallery items are placeholders and require real owned photos

## Next steps before publishing
1. Verify exact owner-approved business name format.
2. Confirm phone, address, hours, and best contact method.
3. Replace sample reviews with permissioned real reviews.
4. Replace gallery placeholders with business-owned photos.
5. Review legal/compliance needs (privacy policy, terms, accessibility checks).
6. Connect real domain, analytics, and form handling if requested.
